# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Diana's GitHub!

## About Me
Iâ€™m @dianaalvarezz, a senior computer science student at Northern Illinois University, set to graduate in May 2025. My journey from Nursing to Computer Science has been one of constant discovery and growth, and Iâ€™m now focused on software development, specializing in Android mobile applications. With a passion for building creative, impactful solutions, Iâ€™m also experienced in technologies like Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ðŸš€ My Current Project
As I dive deeper into mobile app development, Iâ€™m working on an Android application that aims to blend usability with intuitive design. This project is helping me strengthen my skills in Java/Kotlin and the Android SDK, while reinforcing the principles of UI/UX design. You can check out my progress on GitHub and see my evolving journey in mobile development.

## ðŸ’¡ Interests
While Iâ€™m passionate about mobile app development, my curiosity spans across various areas of tech, including:
- Full-stack development
- Data Science & Machine Learning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Time Series Classification

Iâ€™m also a strong advocate for diversity in STEM, particularly supporting women and Latinas in tech, and have been actively involved in leadership roles within student organizations.

## ðŸ’¼ Professional Experience
In addition to my studies, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to intern at Northrop Grumman and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, where I worked on debrief tools using .NET and Avalonia, as well as time series classification systems for magnets using Python. These roles allowed me to work within Agile teams, hone my problem-solving skills, and contribute to cutting-edge projects.

## ðŸ“± Mobile App Development
Learning Android has opened up a world of creativity for me, and Iâ€™m excited to continue building applications that provide real value to users. My goal is to become a proficient full-stack mobile developer and create apps that are as functional as they are aesthetically pleasing.

## ðŸ“« Connect With Me
Letâ€™s collaborate! Whether youâ€™re interested in mobile development, data science, or software engineering, feel free to reach out at diana.alvarez7403@gmail.com. Iâ€™m always open to discussing new ideas, collaborating on projects, or exploring learning opportunities.

## âš¡ Fun Fact
Switching majors from Nursing to Computer Science has been one of the best decisions Iâ€™ve made. Itâ€™s not just about writing code; itâ€™s about creating solutions that can impact lives in meaningful ways. Iâ€™m excited about what the future holds and look forward to contributing to the tech community.
